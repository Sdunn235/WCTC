## 📚 Overview

This repository contains all coursework, labs, and projects completed during **Fall Term 1 (2025)** at WCTC.  
Each class folder includes its modules, lab assignments, and notes.  
My focus this term was on **fundamentals of software development**, **object-oriented programming**, and **front-end design**.

The goal of this repo is twofold:
1. Maintain version-controlled documentation of my coursework for reflection and growth.  
2. Serve as an educational archive to revisit concepts as I advance into later semesters.

## 🌱 Next Steps

- Transition into **Term 2**, expanding on web technologies and backend development.  
- Begin integrating **GitHub portfolio structure** for public presentation of standout projects (e.g., Vending Machine, Club Manager).  
- Continue refining **documentation discipline** for long-term code clarity and personal reference.
