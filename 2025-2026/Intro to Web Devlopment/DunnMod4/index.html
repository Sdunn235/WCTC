                    </header>
                    <p>Know your budget before you fall in love with a legendary beast. Pre-approval estimates your
                        contract range, monthly upkeep, and care plan options so negotiations stay grounded. It won’t
                        affect a bond trial and helps you focus on monsters that truly fit.</p>

                    <p>Combine creature coverage, handler liability, and transport protection in one policy. Bundles
                        often lower total cost while expanding benefits like emergency healing, cooldown reimbursements,
                        and equipment damage coverage.</p>
