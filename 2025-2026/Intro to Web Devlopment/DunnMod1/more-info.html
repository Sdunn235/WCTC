                    <h2>Roles of Front-End and Back-End Developers</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Front-end developers are responsible for designing and implementing the visual aspects of a website
                    or application. They work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user interfaces that are
                    responsive, interactive, and accessible.</p>

                <p>Back-end developers focus on the server side of web development. They handle databases, server logic,
                    and APIs to ensure that data is processed correctly and securely behind the scenes.</p>

                <p>Together, front-end and back-end developers collaborate to build complete web solutions. While the
                    front-end ensures users have a seamless experience, the back-end makes sure everything functions
                    reliably and efficiently.</p>
