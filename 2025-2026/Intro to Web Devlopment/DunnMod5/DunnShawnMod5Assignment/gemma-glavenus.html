                    <p>Gemma Stark was born in the forge cities that glow red even at midnight, where every child learns
                        the cadence of hammer and heat before they learn to write. A blacksmith’s apprentice turned
                        combat engineer, she built her first weapon to control the fury she saw in others—and
                        eventually, in herself. Her encounter with Glavenus was no accident; she sought the beast after
                        witnessing it melt an entire caravan’s armor line in a single sweep. Their battle lasted six
                        hours, the ash thick enough to blot out the sun. When it ended, both lay collapsed amid the
                        slag, the air shimmering from exhaustion and acceptance. Since then, Gemma and Glavenus have
                        moved as one entity—she the tactician, it the embodiment of elemental violence. Their fighting
                        style blends metallurgy and motion: preheating the arena sands to warp enemy footing,
                        redirecting molten debris into calculated arcs, and using each clash to fuel the Glavenus’s
                        blade-tail to greater fury. Off the field, Gemma runs the Harpers’ forgehouse, maintaining
                        weapons for other handlers while studying how emotional focus can alter a beast’s elemental
                        resonance. To her, every battle is a forging—each strike a chance to temper something wild into
                        something enduring. Her creed, engraved above her forge, reads simply: “Only what survives the
                        fire deserves the name.”</p>
