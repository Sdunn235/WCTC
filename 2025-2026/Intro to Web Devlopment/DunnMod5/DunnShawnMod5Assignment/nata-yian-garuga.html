                    </header>
                    <p>Nata Ghasemi was raised among the Skywatchers of the high cliffs—wanderers who built their homes
                        on ridges where thunder spoke first and reason came second. Her earliest lessons were in
                        listening: to the tremor before lightning, to the breath of wind across stone, to the rhythm of
                        wings hidden above the clouds. When the Yian Garuga descended upon her village during the Season
                        of Cracks, she faced it not with weapons but with mirrors of obsidian, redirecting its fury
                        until it exhausted itself into stillness. That moment became her creed: a storm cannot be
                        broken, only understood. In training, Nata works with wind maps and resonance tuning—charting
                        Garuga’s screams to read air pressure and strike patterns. Their combat style is kinetic poetry:
                        dive, vanish, strike, vanish again. Garuga trusts her implicitly, folding its wings at her
                        whisper, wheeling skyward at her heartbeat. In the arena, they are chaos refined—the clash of
                        thunder and breath, of intelligence harnessing instinct. When Nata enters the field, spectators
                        fall silent; when she and Garuga rise together, even the storm hesitates. Those who’ve faced her
                        say it feels less like battle and more like weather—a test of endurance, patience, and the will
                        to remain standing after the sky itself turns against you.</p>
