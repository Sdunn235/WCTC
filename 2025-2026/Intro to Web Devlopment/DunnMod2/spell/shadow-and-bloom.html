                        <p>The Conjuration of the Shadow and Bloom is a ritual designed to summon a spirit companion.
                            Its
                            form is not fixed — the summoned being reflects the intent of the summoner. When performed
                            with a heart leaning toward mischief, cunning, or hidden power, the rite calls forth an
                            imp-like familiar. When performed with gentleness, curiosity, or reverence, the same working
                            instead calls a fey-like companion. The materials of the ritual are neutral; the guiding
                            hand is the will and intent of the one who performs it.
                        </p>

                            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li>A circle of salt, wide enough to sit within</li>

                                <li>7 dried rose petals</li>

                                <li>1 feather (preferably found, not bought)</li>

                                <li>1 shard of obsidian or dark stone</li>

                                <li>1 small bell or chime</li>

                                <li>3 drops of honey</li>

                                <li>1 black candle and 1 green candle</li>

                                <li>A shallow bowl of fresh water</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                            <ol class="decimal">
                                <li>Mark a circle with salt, ensuring you will not be disturbed inside it.</li>

                                <li>Place the black candle on the left side of the circle and the green candle on the
                                    right.</li>

                                <li>Position the bowl of fresh water at the center, placing the obsidian shard on its
                                    rim.</li>

                                <li>Scatter the rose petals evenly around the circle, symbolizing the threshold between
                                    worlds.</li>

                                <li>Hold the feather above the water and drip three drops of honey onto its tip. Let the
                                    honey dissolve into the water as you release the feather into the bowl.</li>

                                <li>Light both candles, one after the other. As you do, state your purpose aloud — what
                                    kind of companion you wish to call.</li>

                                <li>If your intent is sharp, cunning, or mischievous, fix your gaze on
                                    the
                                    black candle.
                                    The shadows it casts will guide the imp.</li>

                                <li>If your intent is gentle, curious, or protective, fix your gaze on
                                    the
                                    green candle.
                                    Its glow will guide the fey..</li>

                                <li>Sprinkle a few drops of the scented water around the salt circle, sealing the
                                    boundary.</li>

                                <li>Place one drop of the scented water directly on the silver coin, watching how the
                                    flame reflects off the wet surface</li>

                                <li>Sit quietly, gazing into the candle, and imagine a silver flame rising and
                                    surrounding you in light.</li>

                                <li>When the flame flickers or your intuition tells you the ritual is complete, thank
                                    the presence.</li>

                                <li>Extinguish the candle and carefully dismantle the circle of salt, scattering it
                                    outside to release the energy.</li>
