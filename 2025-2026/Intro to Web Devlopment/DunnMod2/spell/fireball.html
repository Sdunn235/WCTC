                        <p>The Fireball spell is the chef’s flambé of the battlefield — quick, hot, and impossible to
                            ignore. Instead of long preparation, this version uses the simplest spark, fuel, and
                            willpower, compressed into one breath. In the space of a heartbeat, flame condenses into a
                            sphere and hurtles outward, carrying the caster’s intent to sear and scatter foes. It is
                            volatile, dramatic, and beloved by nearly every magic-user for its sheer impact.
